# Toronto Women's Data Group

The Toronto Women's Data Group brings together a network of over 2,500 women interested in data science, analytics, data engineering, mathematics and statistics, as well as members from the broader community who support our goals. We provide an open, welcoming, and fun environment for women to network, learn, and innovate together. 

Come say hello at our next meetup!
